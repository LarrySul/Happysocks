## About Laravel
### How do we build and run it?
The app is just a laravel app , so once you clone the repo you'll be required to run composer install to pull the needed dependencies . Once that's done you can get up to speed with the apis since I have exported to the repository . Also the published verison of the collection can also be found <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3879258/TzkzqebX#a34d8670-1c62-4a56-94e5-8f416d8d7342">Here</a>

### What tools did you use?
i.) Laravel 8 ii.) Jwt library

### Why did you use them?
Laravel is used to create the application scalfold whilst the jwt library is used to generate access token and also for authorization (middleware) purpose.


### Did you intentionally leave stuff out? In that case, what and why?

YesüòÅ, at the time of putting together this readme , I'm yet to figure out the show leaderboard feature . Hopefully I can get a hang of it
